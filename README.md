## About the Video Course
Swift is probably the best full-stack language in the world. An essential advantage of Swift as a perfect back-end programming language is the safety built into the language. Swift does away with entire classes of errors and crashes. You'll start with getting to know more about server-side Swift, then you'll set up your own environment and hit the ground running by creating your first project with the Vapor framework. You'll also explore Swift Package Manager.

We'll move further into the exciting world of Swift by templating and creating web pages with leaf, managing RESTful APIs. You'll make a responsive web app with Bootstrap and delve more deeply into forms. Working with Vapor and Postgres will be fun as you set up Postgres with your Vapor application and work with fluent ORM. You'll be querying data using Fluent filters and create relationships.

Further into the course, you'll be adding authentication by creating a Sign Up Flow and logins for users. You'll use basic validations and then write your own custom ones. Creating an API will be fun by serializing your data and securing your API with JWT. You'll learn to deploy Heroku and set up SSL. Lastly you'll learn to write integration tests.
